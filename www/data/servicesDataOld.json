In many ways, it’s a straight continuation of what we have been doing for years: <b>helping our clients maximize the operational and business advantage</b> gained from their digital assets.<br>\n<br>\nBut it’s different too. <b>The scale of the data explosion, the growing emphasis on deriving value from unstructured data, and the massive increases in connectivity in the internet of things</b>, all help to form a new data landscape.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in this new landscape, those who are best able to generate differentiating intelligence – often in real-time – will be the ones who achieve and sustain success.\n&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Bring the best business technologist skills together</h3>\n<p>Many of our established skills as business technologists come together in new big data initiatives: <b>Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Enterprise Content Management and Decision Support Systems</b> are all essential competences.</p>\n<p>Things are changing, however, and what were previously discrete or siloed systems now become part of a more interconnected whole. More than ever before, deep knowledge of the different cultures and practices of different sectors creates the added-value.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Make the road by walking</h3>\n<p>\nMany clients of Atos are already beginning to reveal new insight through innovative Information Management and Analytics: traffic moves more freely in busy cities; production and commercial data combine for more agile manufacturing; transparency of usage in electricity consumption helps utility companies minimize environmental impact.<br>\n<br>\nWith Bull, atos technologies, Atos can propose you the best of the art technologies to cover the whole value chain of Big Data, from services to technologies.<br>\n<br>\nFeel free to visit our dedicated website : <a href=\"http://bull.com\" target=\"_blank\">bull.com</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>We are exploring new scenarios with clients in every sector.</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Together, we learn by doing.

Stop experimenting with commodity cloud pilots and discover evolution with complete enterprise cloud.</b></p>\n<h3>The cloud in full</h3>\n<p>The Atos approach to cloud is unlike that of a vendor or a blue-sky consultant. We don’t sell widgets, and we don’t theorise about the future. As business technologists with a pure client focus, we are orchestrators who can put your entire cloud puzzle together. With the security discipline of digital identity thought leaders – and with the core process knowledge of business insiders – we make the cloud safe and straightforward to use. Strengthening the cloud with better service levels and more information integrity, we empower you to freely deploy cloud architectures at any point across your enterprise. Because it’s not the cloud – it should be your cloud, adapted to your individual ecosystem. Techies tell you that cloud computing will change your business. We’re helping business change cloud computing.</p>\n<h3>The cloud to your cloud</h3>\n<p>Atos delivers a full-spectrum cloud strategy – from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/consulting\">modeling and realisation</a> to orchestrated performance of entire <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/infrastructure\">IaaS</a>, <a href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/platform\">PaaS</a> and <a href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/software\">SaaS</a> layers. We also deliver business process as a service, adapted for your exact market and environment. We transform what others call “the” cloud into your cloud – be it <a target=\"_blank\"></a>private, public, hybrid, community or any combination. Whatever the technical organisation, we make it a business model fit for deployment across your complete enterprise. Atos has already pioneered working models for highly complex scenarios such as media and healthcare – virtualising not just commodity services but core processes. Don’t simply leverage on-demand delivery, use cloud to create your next business ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>The business impact</h3>\n<p>Atos has been instrumental in establishing cloud architectures in the public arena, for example, one of the most diverse deployment environments, GoBerlin is the first citizen focused platform on mainland Europe run on community cloud principles. This pioneering solution actually connects citizens, civil authorities and local stakeholders based on every-day scenarios. These are the kinds of business impact achievable with fully orchestrated cloud. Another example is the cloud-based innovation of core media processes such as content creation and distribution. With Atos as your business technologists, you can use cloud delivery to do far more than drive cost out of IT. Flex to real-time business ebb and flow. Collaborate across silos and borders. Empower new global subsidiaries. Cloud can bridge technology and business like never before.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"containercolumn contains_1col\"><div class=\"parsys rightpar\"><div class=\"parbase textimage section contactpane\"><!--Contact pane section start-->\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<h2 class=\"red conthead\">Contact us</h2>\n<div class=\"vcard marleft\">\n\n<div class=\"conimgno\">\n<span class=\"username usermargin fix conimgno\">Atos UK </span><br />\n<span class=\"userdegin conimgno\"></span>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"marbot\"><img src=\"/etc/designs/neoweb/images/trans-1-px.gif\" title=\"\" height=\"4\" width=\"100\" alt=\"trans-1-px\"/></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"contact-further-options vcard  marleft emailbot emailtop liststyle\">\n<li class=\"contact-email txtwidth\" title=\" E-mail  Atos UK\"><a href=\"mailto:ukwebenquiries@atos.net\" class=\"contact-email_ a\">  E-mail  Atos UK</a></li>\n           \n<li class=\"contact-telephone\">+44 (0)20 7830 4444 </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<!--Contact pane section end--></div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase article section\"><h2>Download Brochure</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/content/dam/uk/documents/we-do/atos-cloud-brochure.pdf\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/content/dam/uk/images/we-do/cloudservices.jpg\" title=\" Freedom business unleashed-enterprise cloud computings\" alt=\" Freedom business unleashed-enterprise cloud computing\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/content/dam/uk/documents/we-do/atos-cloud-brochure.pdf\" title=\"Download Brochure Freedom business unleashed-enterprise cloud computing\" target=\"_blank\">Download Brochure Freedom business unleashed-enterprise cloud computing&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"},

Convergence across devices, applications, networks and access channels is simultaneously creating numerous new opportunities such as IP telephony, unified communications and multimedia services.<br>\n<br>\nFor companies en route to using utility and cloud computing, the answer lies in virtualisation; complementing or replacing dedicated networking appliances with a virtual resource to enable consolidation and optimal scalability.<br>\n<br>\nAtos’s Network and Communication Services are one of the ways we are helping clients lower their infrastructure costs and increase performance through our transformation offering services such as network acceleration and virtualisation. These services enable companies to shift their workload from dedicated routers, firewalls and load balancing appliances to virtual service architecture capable of dispensing scalable capacity on demand.<br>\n<br>\nResources are pooled across the virtual service architecture, making abundant capacity available at a much lower cost than dedicated solutions allow. When a surge or other unplanned increase in demand necessitates additional resources, more capacity is dispensed automatically. Resources are continuously managed so that the appropriate capacity is delivered when and where it’s needed.<br>\n<br>\nIn managing such issues, Atos investigates whether the customer’s network environment and its utilisation complies with the new business and/or technical requirements.

Used effectively, SIAM’s ‘mix and match’ approach can free up organisations from vendor lock-ins, and enables coexistence within the same operating framework of large-scale commodity suppliers with niche SME suppliers that can be leveraged for innovation in delivery.<br>\n<br>\nSIAM can enable the integration of both digital and traditional infrastructure services within a single operating model, and can bring process excellence and clear, multi-level governance that can transform ICT delivery. The structure of the SIAM operating model is not ‘one size fits all, and can be tailored through consultation to meet the specific needs of each organisation, allowing the organisation to choose the level of retained versus outsourced service integration responsibility, based on retained IT organisation capability and maturity.</p></div><h3>Benefits of SIAM</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The strengths of multiple suppliers can be harnessed to source ‘best fit’ services</li>\n<li>Freed from traditional management duties, the retained in-house IT department is better able to focus on the user, drive strategic service delivery, and manage its relationship with the business</li>\n<li>Clear lines of management responsibility enable greater control and access to supplier capabilities</li>\n<li>Avoids supplier, brand, or timescale ‘lock in’ and end-to-end service silos</li>\n<li>Enables a ‘best-of-breed’ approach from the most appropriate specialist providers within a flexible ‘plug-and-play’ environment</li>\n<li>Drives cost-effective operations by increasing competition and encouraging value for money pricing and terms</li>\n<li>Provides greater transparency and accountability across the supply chain</li>\n<li>Enables a collaborative framework to be created between suppliers, encouraging the right behaviours to support contracted and desired outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Atos experience</h3>\n<p>Atos delivers SIAM services and solutions to UK and international customers – often within very large and complex multi-vendor IT environments where mission-critical services have to meet demanding deadlines. We respond flexibly to our customers’ different preferred models, adopting the role best suited to the requirement such as SIAM strategic consultant, SIAM design authority, SIAM Transition assurance partner, SIAM delivery provider, , or Tower provider.<br>\n<br>\nOur approach as SIAM provider always ensures that the future operating model is designed collaboratively through consultation, that a clearly defined Transition model id developed to enable the future mode of operation whilst balancing cost and minimising disruption, and that the future multi-Tower delivery model is constructed to sustainably deliver the outcomes required.</p>\n<h3>Our SIAM partnership typically ensures:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An enterprise-wide architecture and services portfolio approach</li>\n<li>Target supply chain model, operating model, and delivery programme that focuses on client agility and delivering more for less cost</li>\n<li>Integration of the customer’s end-to-end ICT services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our public and commercial customers include:</p>\n<h3>Post Office</h3>\n<p>Atos delivers a SIAM role, operating a central Service Desk and Service Management function across incumbent suppliers and tower service supply chain members. Atos is also responsible for implementing tower service provider solutions, and enabling an effective exit from incumbent supplier arrangements while ensuring continuity of service.</p>\n<h3>MOD Strategic Partner</h3>\n<p>Atos works closely with the in-house team to enable a major in-house programme transition to a SIAM and service tower model. We help the MOD to meet Government ICT strategy objectives. We also enable more cost effective information solutions sourcing, while maintaining end user services and improved flexibility.</p>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"containercolumn contains_1col\"><div class=\"parsys rightpar\"><div class=\"parbase textimage section contactpane\"><!--Contact pane section start-->\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<h2 class=\"red conthead\">Contact us</h2>\n<div class=\"vcard marleft\">\n\n<div class=\"conimgno\">\n<span class=\"username usermargin fix conimgno\">Keith Cooke</span><br />\n<span class=\"userdegin conimgno\">UK SIAM Lead </span>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"contact-further-options vcard  marleft emailbot emailtop liststyle\">\n<li class=\"contact-email txtwidth\" title=\" E-mail  Keith\"><a href=\"mailto:ukwebenquiries@atos.net\" class=\"contact-email_ a\">  E-mail  Keith</a></li>\n           \n<li class=\"contact-telephone\">+44 (0)20 7830 4444</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<!--Contact pane section end--></div>\r\n"},

Social media has created online communities linking people regardless of location or time zone. For a generation brought up with these technologies the idea of a workplace without them is unthinkable – and the same is happening now with enterprise social collaboration.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Your journey to social collaboration, enabled by Atos</h3>\n<p><br>\nIn most businesses there is no single platform that delivers multiple methods of collaborating, sharing and managing projects and workflow, making it necessary to carefully assess the needs of the business and determine the most effective route towards further integration. Our approach enables us to help you based on our practical experiences of the challenges and obstacles we needed to overcome in a real, working environment.<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\nOnce we have established a clear view of your business we then start to define a roadmap that will move you towards a fully enabled collaborative environment at a pace that suits the needs and expectations of your business.<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\nGetting this pace right is critical to the success of the project: moving too fast will lose the support of your employees whilst moving too slowly will lead to disillusionment as they fail to see the benefits of the new system quickly enough.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Choosing the right technology</h3>\n<p><br>\nEvery collaborative solution requires the careful integration of different technologies to create the right landscape for the individual business. This includes a range of different applications that go far beyond communication and social networking tools to include content management, process handling, resource planning, analysis, interpretation and reporting.<br>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It’s essential to ensure that these applications are carefully integrated to create a seamless social platform rather than simply implement a series of disconnected and unstructured communication and resource management solutions.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Atos working smarter with blueKiwi</h3>\n<p><br>\nAt Atos we chose <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/en/\" title=\"blueKiwi\" target=\"_blank\">blueKiwi</a> Software to help us on our journey to social collaboration, and we are happy to demonstrate today how they help over 60,000 employees in 4,000 active communities across 47 countries collaborate with each other daily to manage projects and workflow. <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/en/\" title=\"blueKiwi\" target=\"_blank\">blueKiwi</a> is a leading provider of enterprise social collaboration software. Its solutions help companies of all sizes – and across industries as diverse as financial services, insurance, banking, telecommunications, utilities, retail, and consulting firms – connect with their customers through an enterprise social network. <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/en/\" title=\"blueKiwi\" target=\"_blank\">blueKiwi</a> social networking software enables organisations to improve productivity and grow innovation through the open and collaborative sharing between internal (employee, member, or management) and external (customer, partner, or supplier) communities. <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/en/\" title=\"blueKiwi\" target=\"_blank\">blueKiwi</a> is hosted SaaS (software on demand) with the option of a Private Cloud configuration.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>The new workplace</h3>\n<p><br>\nWith a collaborative environment, based on social media, the new workplace is wherever it needs to be. Mobility is the new standard and employees will be free to work where and when they are most productive. Careful management will create a much more flexible approach that better serves the work/life balance of the individual and the needs of the business.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Looking beyond email</h3>\n<p><br>\nOur Zero email™ offering is based on our own objective to eliminate internal email by the end of 2013. At Atos, we believe that Zero email™ is the best managerial concept to drive our organisation to become a truly social organisation, fully adopting the technologies of the future workplace.<br>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on our own experience we have created an approach that will help you transform the way employees communicate and collaborate. The offering combines our long history and expertise in consulting with international enterprises and national bodies, implementing leading-edge technologies, and running business processes in a secure environment. We work in partnership with our clients, defining their ideal ‘to be’ environment and crafting the building blocks of change that suit them.</p>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"containercolumn contains_1col\"><div class=\"parsys rightpar\"><div class=\"parbase textimage section contactpane\"><!--Contact pane section start-->\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<h2 class=\"red conthead\">Contact us</h2>\n<div class=\"vcard marleft\">\n\n<div class=\"conimgno\">\n<span class=\"username usermargin fix conimgno\">Atos UK </span><br />\n<span class=\"userdegin conimgno\"></span>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"marbot\"><img src=\"/etc/designs/neoweb/images/trans-1-px.gif\" title=\"\" height=\"4\" width=\"100\" alt=\"trans-1-px\"/></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"contact-further-options vcard  marleft emailbot emailtop liststyle\">\n<li class=\"contact-email txtwidth\" title=\"Contact Atos UK\"><a href=\"http://uk.atos.net/en-uk/home/contact-us/contact-form.html?xud=SHD-UVuKh8PLGc7Qs7_OzA \" class=\"contact-email_a\"> Contact Atos UK</a></li>\n           \n<li class=\"contact-telephone\">+44 (0)20 7830 4444 </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<!--Contact pane section end--></div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase article section\"><h2>Download Brochure</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/content/dam/uk/documents/we-do/atos-social-collaboration-brochure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img title=\"Download Social Collaboration Brochure\" alt=\"Download Social Collaboration Brochure\" src=\"/content/dam/uk/images/we-do/social-collaboration-brochure.jpg\"></a>&nbsp; <a title=\"Download Social Collaboration brochure\" href=\"/content/dam/uk/documents/we-do/atos-social-collaboration-brochure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download Brochure</a><br>\n</p>\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase section reference\"><div style=\"display:inline;\" class=\"cq-dd-paragraph\"></div>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"},
