Stop experimenting with commodity cloud pilots and discover evolution with complete enterprise cloud.</b></p>\n<h3>The cloud in full</h3>\n<p>The Atos approach to cloud is unlike that of a vendor or a blue-sky consultant. We don’t sell widgets, and we don’t theorise about the future. As business technologists with a pure client focus, we are orchestrators who can put your entire cloud puzzle together. With the security discipline of digital identity thought leaders – and with the core process knowledge of business insiders – we make the cloud safe and straightforward to use. Strengthening the cloud with better service levels and more information integrity, we empower you to freely deploy cloud architectures at any point across your enterprise. Because it’s not the cloud – it should be your cloud, adapted to your individual ecosystem. Techies tell you that cloud computing will change your business. We’re helping business change cloud computing.</p>\n<h3>The cloud to your cloud</h3>\n<p>Atos delivers a full-spectrum cloud strategy – from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/consulting\">modeling and realisation</a> to orchestrated performance of entire <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/infrastructure\">IaaS</a>, <a href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/platform\">PaaS</a> and <a href=\"http://canopy-cloud.com/software\">SaaS</a> layers. We also deliver business process as a service, adapted for your exact market and environment. We transform what others call “the” cloud into your cloud – be it <a target=\"_blank\"></a>private, public, hybrid, community or any combination. Whatever the technical organisation, we make it a business model fit for deployment across your complete enterprise. Atos has already pioneered working models for highly complex scenarios such as media and healthcare – virtualising not just commodity services but core processes. Don’t simply leverage on-demand delivery, use cloud to create your next business ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>The business impact</h3>\n<p>Atos has been instrumental in establishing cloud architectures in the public arena, for example, one of the most diverse deployment environments, GoBerlin is the first citizen focused platform on mainland Europe run on community cloud principles. This pioneering solution actually connects citizens, civil authorities and local stakeholders based on every-day scenarios. These are the kinds of business impact achievable with fully orchestrated cloud. Another example is the cloud-based innovation of core media processes such as content creation and distribution. With Atos as your business technologists, you can use cloud delivery to do far more than drive cost out of IT. Flex to real-time business ebb and flow. Collaborate across silos and borders.

Used effectively, SIAM’s ‘mix and match’ approach can free up organisations from vendor lock-ins, and enables coexistence within the same operating framework of large-scale commodity suppliers with niche SME suppliers that can be leveraged for innovation in delivery.<br>\n<br>\nSIAM can enable the integration of both digital and traditional infrastructure services within a single operating model, and can bring process excellence and clear, multi-level governance that can transform ICT delivery. The structure of the SIAM operating model is not ‘one size fits all, and can be tailored through consultation to meet the specific needs of each organisation, allowing the organisation to choose the level of retained versus outsourced service integration responsibility, based on retained IT organisation capability and maturity.</p>\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase article section\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Atos’ SIAM model</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/content/dam/uk/images/your-business/The%20complexity%20of%20managing%20service%20integration.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/content/dam/uk/images/your-business/The-complexity-of-managing-service-integration-small2.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Click here for a larger version\" href=\"/content/dam/uk/images/your-business/The complexity of managing service integration.png\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for a larger version</a></p>\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase article section\"><h3>Benefits of SIAM</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The strengths of multiple suppliers can be harnessed to source ‘best fit’ services</li>\n<li>Freed from traditional management duties, the retained in-house IT department is better able to focus on the user, drive strategic service delivery, and manage its relationship with the business</li>\n<li>Clear lines of management responsibility enable greater control and access to supplier capabilities</li>\n<li>Avoids supplier, brand, or timescale ‘lock in’ and end-to-end service silos</li>\n<li>Enables a ‘best-of-breed’ approach from the most appropriate specialist providers within a flexible ‘plug-and-play’ environment</li>\n<li>Drives cost-effective operations by increasing competition and encouraging value for money pricing and terms</li>\n<li>Provides greater transparency and accountability across the supply chain</li>\n<li>Enables a collaborative framework to be created between suppliers, encouraging the right behaviours to support contracted and desired outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Atos experience</h3>\n<p>Atos delivers SIAM services and solutions to UK and international customers – often within very large and complex multi-vendor IT environments where mission-critical services have to meet demanding deadlines.

Social media has created online communities linking people regardless of location or time zone. For a generation brought up with these technologies the idea of a workplace without them is unthinkable – and the same is happening now with enterprise social collaboration.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Your journey to social collaboration, enabled by Atos</h3>\n<p><br>\nIn most businesses there is no single platform that delivers multiple methods of collaborating, sharing and managing projects and workflow, making it necessary to carefully assess the needs of the business and determine the most effective route towards further integration. Our approach enables us to help you based on our practical experiences of the challenges and obstacles we needed to overcome in a real, working environment.<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\nOnce we have established a clear view of your business we then start to define a roadmap that will move you towards a fully enabled collaborative environment at a pace that suits the needs and expectations of your business.<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\nGetting this pace right is critical to the success of the project: moving too fast will lose the support of your employees whilst moving too slowly will lead to disillusionment as they fail to see the benefits of the new system quickly enough.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Choosing the right technology</h3>\n<p><br>\nEvery collaborative solution requires the careful integration of different technologies to create the right landscape for the individual business. This includes a range of different applications that go far beyond communication and social networking tools to include content management, process handling, resource planning, analysis, interpretation and reporting.<br>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It’s essential to ensure that these applications are carefully integrated to create a seamless social platform rather than simply implement a series of disconnected and unstructured communication and resource management solutions.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Atos working smarter with blueKiwi</h3>\n<p><br>\nAt Atos we chose <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/en/\" title=\"blueKiwi\" target=\"_blank\">blueKiwi</a> Software to help us on our journey to social collaboration, and we are happy to demonstrate today how they help over 60,000 employees in 4,000 active communities across 47 countries collaborate with each other daily to manage projects and workflow. <a href=\"http://www.bluekiwi-software.com/en/\" title=\"blueKiwi\" target=\"_blank\">blueKiwi</a> is a leading provider of enterprise social collaboration software.

Mobility is the new standard and employees will be free to work where and when they are most productive. Careful management will create a much more flexible approach that better serves the work/life balance of the individual and the needs of the business.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Looking beyond email</h3>\n<p><br>\nOur Zero email™ offering is based on our own objective to eliminate internal email by the end of 2013.

If managed in the right way, that has a positive impact on agility, efficiency and costs on the one hand. On the other hand it also raises new challenges for IT service management.<br>\n<br>\nCloud Solutions for Business Integration from Atos cover primarily the consulting and design services needed to allow customer usage of both services from their own premises as well as from private or public clouds. Selective cloud sourcing enables enterprises to maintain a balance between security and efficiency.<br>\n<br>\nAs part of the Atos approach to selective cloud sourcing, we have established a process platform for managing hybrid cloud environments and integrating and harmonising the growing number of different services. This enables you not only to choose between private, hybrid or community clouds with equal confidence in the integration and operation skills of your partner. You can also leverage a full set of infrastructure, platform and software services without the complexity of cloud multi-sourcing.<br>\n<br>\nHybrid Cloud Solutions are in high demand, for example whenever an individual ICT infrastructure has been conceptualised during previous consulting engagements. Atos delivers you a fully thought-through set of answers from finding your way to the cloud and integrating it with legacy systems to running it effectively.

We have operational know-how and we are technology agnostic in our consulting engagements. Atos leverages best-in-class designs while we help our clients strategically and tactically deploy complex programmes. We reduce your time and risk based on our experience. Let our Business Technologists help you succeed the first time you deploy a Data Centre transformation programme in your organisation</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many factors come into the decision matrix for Data Centre transformation programmes. Not only the typical location, power, tax, outsourcing, and employment base decisions, but new factors including cloud, the impact of Moore’s law on compute infrastructure, and green environmental initiatives. Furthermore economic impacts for the cost of capital, across the globe, have shifted the buy versus rent decisions for many corporations. This includes additional options to leverage container, pre-fabricated, or co-locate data centre space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Atos takes the risk out of starting your Journey to Data Centre transformation. Atos brings experience in Data Centre consolidation through discovery of assets and application linkages, rapid ROI assessments, application rationalisation plans, cloud migration factories, detailed business cases, high level designs, and detailed migration planning. Then we bring the experts in to execute an on time and successful Data Centre transformation programme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While many companies will attempt these programmes on their own or with a technology partner, they may not initially be successful. Technology is only part of the equation and many IT organisations are not structured for successful negotiations and governance with the lines of business to consolidate into a common shared pool of IT resources. Business and IT Governance strategies are critical to changing the way IT serves the business – IT must become like a broker of services that are sourced both internally as well as externally.

In fact, some of the typical characteristics of the mainframe, like its 100% availability and ability to perform consistently at over 90% workload, continuously, its ingrained security and ability to shift workloads between machines, are exactly what private and public enterprises of today are looking for in performance.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe mainframe is often perceived as expensive, monolithic and inflexible, yet for high performance transactions as well as in environments with continuous high throughput levels, mainframes – when configured well – can be more cost-efficient and performing than any other system.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Enter the business technologists from Atos</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With our large European mainframe consolidation and years of expertise in mainframe services, Atos has continuously strived to deliver mainframe services that are at once future oriented, cost-efficient, reliable, secure and flexible. Our environment is large enough for any organisation (of any size today and tomorrow) to benefit immediately from economies of scale and that in a Pay-per-Use model which makes it ultimately versatile. Not only can you scale-up and -down according to business needs, you also won’t need huge capital investments in underutilised resources.</p>\n<p><br>\nOur vision of hybrid and on Demand Mainframe Services is exactly what you’re looking for if you need to have your legacy run at peak performance as a dynamic enhancement within your entire IT environment – including cloudscapes.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<h3>Why mainframes may well be the most modern solution</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In spite of repeated rumors of their demise, mainframes seem to be ultimately equipped for the speed of business today. The mainframe is largely unchallenged, since it can be fully loaded with an enormous volume of work which it will continue to process indefinitely and uninterruptedly, with no fuss or bother.</p>\n<p><br>\nConsider the relevance of mainframes in the age of cloud computing, where resource pooling and on demand and pay-per-use models have radically altered technology and delivery models. In fact, whilst claiming to be innovative, many advocates of cloud services are actually “reinventing the mainframe” in many aspects of what they are trying to achieve. E.g. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the infrastructure level of Cloud, is essentially a well-established utility computing service. The concepts involved have been around in the mainframe world for over 40 years. Mainframe in itself is a utility service, and has almost always been so. Mainframe services in the on Demand format from Atos are the ultimate form of utility services.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"/content/dam/global/images/we-do/Atos_mainframe_big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/content/dam/global/images/we-do/Atos_mainframe.jpg\" alt=\"Transition services\" title=\"Transition services\"></a><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<h3>How mainframes prove their relevance in hybrid environments</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mainframe has evolved to become more open – it has proven to be very versatile and can run a range of environments (also in a multi-application environment model) from classic application development software like COBOL and Assembler to the most modern platforms (Java, XML, SOA). In fact, it is at once infinitely backward compatible while at the same time offering integration facilities for all modern platforms.<br>\n<br>\nThis makes the mainframe inherently hybrid and ultimately prepared for providing your computing power and transactional throughput at the speed of your business.<br>\n<br>\nWith the introduction of “zEnterprise”, the latest generation of mainframes, it is also the first platform to deliver an out of the box, integrated hybrid computing solution.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, beyond mainframe expertise and cloud savvy, you need expert legacy integration, security skills and governance capabilities to establish a truly hybrid and fully integrated environment. We have that expertise and can partner alongside of you to dimension an environment fit for your business and future challenges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>And the price is right too</h3>\n<p><br>\nMany will claim that mainframes are not only obsolete and inflexible, but very expensive too. On the contrary however, mainframes are very cost-effective, when compared against Unix, Linux and Windows running on distributed systems, on a per-user basis. Actually, with the right set up and for specific functionalities mainframes are often the most cost-efficient solution at best performance.<br>\n<br>\nAtos helps customers all over the world to bring out the business bonus that mainframes can deliver.

This is all the more important as devices are changing and the way we communicate evolves with those. Companies used to work with PCs and networks primarily for communication via email. Real-time communication was a separate function with its own line via telephone or dedicated video links. Now, this has increasingly shifted to IP networks. Modern DSL lines with megabit speeds and appropriate routers ensure clear and seamless transmissions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the Communications solution as part of the Network and Communications offering, Atos ensures that all your employees can communicate with each other in real-time – anytime and anywhere.

Our comprehensive experience with different platforms allows us to act accordingly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our offering Communications covers Managed Voice Services and comprises communication servers, business applications such as computer telephony integration (CTI), unified messaging services (UMS) or automatic call distribution (ACD) as well as gateways, collaboration applications and video conference components.

In order to achieve this goal you will require a highly scalable and flexible network infrastructure. It should enable you to respond in a dynamical and cost-effective way to everyday resource demands – however unpredictable they may be. The business technologists from Atos will leverage your network and communications potential with Foundation and Transformation components for Network and Communications.</p>\n<h3>Transform for mobility</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In many cases, transforming the enterprise network is not optional, it is imperative. This is the case when systems break down; your network cannot support some of the latest technologies or becomes terribly expensive to keep up. Especially mobility requirements as well as opportunities have grown in many companies over the last few years. However, network and communications architectures did not always evolve at the same pace.<br>\n<br>\nWith our Foundation and Transformation components we provide consulting services to investigate and analyse your business needs. Depending on the analysis, we propose the replacement of a customer’s existing network infrastructure with a more appropriate alternative which is either managed by Atos or by the customer.<br>\n<br>\nAmong others you will benefit from a three phases transformation strategy: at first, new network infrastructures and services have to be designed to enhance the network performance. Secondly, we analyse the gap between your current and your future network. In the next step we will design blueprints for the future network solution.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, you will profit from a stable, reliable, cost-effective and manageable network environment that is in line with your business and technical needs.

Open, multi-platform communication is fast becoming the norm – and it’s commonplace for content to be expressed in multiple ‘dimensions’ at once.<br>\n<br>\nThere is now a stronger focus on social networks among people who share business interests and activities. Group communities form the central information and communication hub for different topics, and work is done more quickly and to a higher standard. Blogs, wikis, instant messaging, and social media tools, to name a few, are all in common usage in our private lives and are starting to enter the professional environment.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, they are rarely properly integrated in the professional sphere to support a natural flow of work.</p>\n<h3>Taking advantage of new tools</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our Zero email™ offering changes all that. Zero email™ is not an ambition in itself, but more a side effect of smarter usage of the collaboration tools available today. Based on our own experience, we have created an approach which will help you transform the way employees communicate and collaborate.<br>\n<br>\nWe aim to encourage innovation, ensure a more agile enterprise, and speed up time to market for new services and products. Our inimitable new offering will allow you to effectively control information overflow and introduce much-needed transparency into information management.</p>\n<h3>Looking beyond email</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Atos, we believe that Zero email™ is the best managerial concept to drive our organization to become a truly social organisation, fully adopting the technologies of the future workplace. Working with you we will help make collaboration tools the cornerstone of your IT landscape, helping define the evolutionary path for your business, based on solid objectives and a strong business case. Collaboration is about people and, as the workforce evolves, so will the expectations of your employees.<br>\n<br>\nWe understand this and as a result every aspect of our solution is designed with the user in mind. Only by doing this can we deliver the full benefit of collaboration and give your people the tools they need to give your business long-term competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"/content/dam/global/images/we-do/zero-email-evolution-cycle.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Zero email Evolution Cycle\"><img src=\"/content/dam/global/images/we-do/zero-email-evolution-cycle_s.jpg\"></a></p>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"containercolumn contains_1col\"><div class=\"parsys rightpar\"><div class=\"parbase textimage section contactpane\"><!--Contact pane section start-->\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<h2 class=\"red conthead\">Contact us</h2>\n<div class=\"vcard marleft\">\n\n<div class=\"conimgno\">\n<span class=\"username usermargin fix conimgno\">Atos UK </span><br />\n<span class=\"userdegin conimgno\"></span>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"marbot\"><img src=\"/etc/designs/neoweb/images/trans-1-px.gif\" title=\"\" height=\"4\" width=\"100\" alt=\"trans-1-px\"/></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"contact-further-options vcard  marleft emailbot emailtop liststyle\">\n<li class=\"contact-email txtwidth\" title=\"Contact Atos UK\"><a href=\"http://uk.atos.net/en-uk/home/contact-us/contact-form.html?xud=SHD-UVuKh8PLGc7Qs7_OzA \" class=\"contact-email_a\"> Contact Atos UK</a></li>\n           \n<li class=\"contact-telephone\">+44 (0)20 7830 4444 </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<!--Contact pane section end--></div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase article section\"><h2>Download Brochure</h2>\n<p>Our Zero email™ offering evolutionises the communication and collaboration processes within your enterprise.<br>\n<a title=\"Download Brochure\" href=\"/content/dam/uk/documents/we-do/atos-zero-email-brochure-lores.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img title=\"Download brochure Smarters eorking with Zero Email\" alt=\"Download brochure Smarters eorking with Zero Email\" src=\"/content/dam/uk/images/we-do/zero-email-brochure.jpg\"></a> <a title=\"Download brochure Smarters eorking with Zero Email\" href=\"/content/dam/uk/documents/we-do/atos-zero-email-brochure-lores.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download brochure Smarters working with Zero Email &gt;&gt;</a><br>\n</p>\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"parbase article section\"><h2>Related Link</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://atos.net/en-us/home/we-are/zero-email.html\" title=\"Zero Email\">Internal Zero email™ initiative &gt;&gt;</a></p>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n","subPages":[]},
